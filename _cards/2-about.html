	<p>As an experienced developer and troubleshooter, I'm able to offer a wide range of web-related services. Whether you're looking for a simple landing page, or a fully-custom web app, I have all the skills and expertise needed to make your project a success.</p>
	<p>Delivering on time and on budget is a priority for me, as well as regularly keeping you up to date on your project's progress. Even before that, the first stage is to discuss your requirements in detail, so I can put together a plan to suit your needs and budget.</p>
